# About the Dataset

Link to Dataset::::: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/us-consumer-finance-complaints  
Each week the CFPB sends thousands of consumers’ complaints about financial products and services to companies for response.  
Those complaints are published here after the company responds or after 15 days, whichever comes first.  
By adding their voice, consumers help improve the financial marketplace.  
The dataset has over 500,000 complaints.  
Using Tableau I'm going to draw out some insights and answer questions that am interested in.


## QUESTIONS::
•	Why the high number of complaints in 2014? 


After cleaning the data and doing a **Root Cause Analysis using the 5 why's**, I found out the Root cause of the high number of complaints in 2014 & the sudden decline from 2015;

> **Initial Problem: Why the high number of complaints in 2014?**
* The product with the most complaints is **Mortgage**,
>but why?;
* **Issues** with/related **Loan** are the cause for the high number of increasing complaints,
>why so much issues related to loans?.
* Bank of America recorded the highest number of complaints & issues,
>Why did Bank of America have such high nuber of complaints?.
* **CA & FL** are the leading states with the most issues & complaints, further analysis should be carried out to know why.
> **Limitations::** There is not enough demographic data on the states to determine why most of the loan issues came from **CA & FL**
> AFter Investigating the reason for increase in complaints, I wanted to know why the suddent decline from 2015.
### What is the cause of decline in complaints from 2015?
* Did the companies drop the product causing alot of complaints(**Mortage**)?
> The same products are still in service so why the decline in complaints so NO mortgage was not dropped from the products, 
* Since the same products are still available, were they improved, did the complaints reduce significantly?
> Thers's been a significant decrease in the number of complaints on the product **Mortgage**; It's safe to assume they're improving on it. But am intrested in knowing if the Loan related issues decreased as well.
#### Did Loan related issues decrease as well?
* Did the companies improve their products(**Mortgage** especially)?Did they
 > I can see a steady amd significant decline in the Loan related issues as well so I can say there's been an improvement on their products.
