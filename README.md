# About the Dataset

Link to Dataset::::: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/us-consumer-finance-complaints  
About Dataset Each week the CFPB sends thousands of consumers’ complaints about financial products and services to companies for response.  
Those complaints are published here after the company responds or after 15 days, whichever comes first.  
By adding their voice, consumers help improve the financial marketplace.  
Using Tableau I'm going to draw out some insights and answer questions that am interested in.


## QUESTIONS::
•	States with the most complaints?  
•	What are the products with the greatest number of disputes?  
•	What is the trend of complaints over time?  
•	What are the top 5 companies with the most 'Loan" related issues?  
•	Does the channel of complaints submission affect speed of responses?  
•	Which companies have closed the most issues with monetary relief?
